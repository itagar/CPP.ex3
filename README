1.	There is a difference between the different modes.
	We can see that the Parallel mode performed better than the Non-Parallel mode especially
	in the big file. The Parallel mode lowered the time complexity by taking each row of the
	Matrix and working on it separately at the same time. These difference between the two files
	occurred because in the small file the amount of time to open all the threads for the Matrix
	is bigger than the actual input itself and the Non-Parallel mode performed slightly better
	in the small file (for a small input).

2.	There is a difference between the addition operation and the multiplication operation.
	The addition operation showed smaller differences between the two modes than the differences
	in the multiplication operation, this is because the complexity of the multiplication is
	transformed from O(n^3) to O(n^2), while the complexity of the addition transformed
	from O(n^2) to O(n).
